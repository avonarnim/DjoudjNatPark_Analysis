- We implemented the initial paper's model, finding slightly different results than the original paper. We used Euler's method to approximate the progress of the system.
- One issue with the paper is that it does not identify what the value of `D` (the half saturation constant) should be. This value is supposed to indicate/control the prey population at which the growth rate will be half of the maximum rate.
